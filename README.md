# .dotfiles

These are my configuration dotfiles I use on my Mac. I have this
folder cloned as `~/.dotfiles`, and when I run `update.bash` it
symlinks everything of importance into my home folder.

That way I don't have to make my entire home folder a git repository,
but still can enjoy the benefits of versioned dotfiles. Hooray!
